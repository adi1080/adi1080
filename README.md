Hi there 👋, I'm Aditya!
I'm a third-year student currently pursuing a degree in Btech/CSE. My journey so far has been fueled by a deep curiosity for technology and a constant drive to improve myself, both personally and professionally.

🚀 Tech Stack & Interests
Java: From building small projects to understanding complex systems, Java has been my go-to language. I'm especially drawn to backend development and object-oriented design.

Spring Boot: I’ve been exploring Spring Boot for creating scalable and efficient backend applications. I enjoy building RESTful services and learning how Spring Boot simplifies microservices architecture.

Angular: Front-end development is a challenge I love! With Angular, I’ve been building interactive web applications and improving my understanding of TypeScript, RxJS, and component-based architecture.

💡 Always Learning
I believe that learning is a never-ending journey, and I'm passionate about gaining new knowledge every day.I always try to expand my understanding of tech and development best practices.

👨‍💻 What I'm Working On
Developing full-stack applications using Java (Spring Boot) and Angular.

Exploring spring security and cloud technologies.

Improving my knowledge of software design patterns and clean code practices.

📈 Goals
Build real-world, scalable applications.

Contribute to open-source projects.

Master advanced concepts in Spring Boot, Angular, and software architecture.

I’m always excited to collaborate, share knowledge, and learn from the community. Feel free to connect or open an issue if you’d like to chat about tech or potential projects!
